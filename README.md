# ACCKW TopSky plugin

The TopSky plugin (a.k.a. The Plugin Formerly Known As “EUROCAT 2000 E”) started out as a very small project to create a couple of customized aircraft tag items, but as more information about the real system and the possibilities with the plugin development became available, it slowly grew to include an almost complete set of tag items, tag menus, graphical elements on the radar display and some additional functionality.

This plugin is for users with at least a basic understanding of ATC procedures and terminology, and being familiar with the operation of the EuroScope program itself. Refer to the EuroScope documentation for the most current information on the program’s features. Because of the complexity of the plugin, some offline practice is recommended before attempting to control online traffic with it.
